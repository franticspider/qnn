# QNN
R package for measuring evolutionary activity, so called becuase it is a "Quantitative, Non-Neutral" measure. This means that the analysis yields a number that can be used to compare activity between samples, and that the measure is based on the idea that any non-neutral evolutionary change will be detected. 

##TODO:

###General tidy up of the package

###Include sample data

###Add the EClark measure
